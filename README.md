# Predicting diabetes
### Dataset
The dataset used in this project is originally from National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK). This project aims at building a logsitic regression model to predict diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements used as predictors, which include BMI, insulin level, age, pregnancies, glucose plasma, blood pressure, skin thickness, and diabetes pedigree function. The outcome variable is a binary one indicating whether or not the pateients have diabetes.

The R code in this project for data visualization and logistic regression was written in R Markdown and knitted to html.
#### Variable description
* Preganancies: Number of times pregnant
* Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration in an oral glucose tolerance test
* BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
* SkinThickness: Triceps skinfold thickness(mm)
* Insulin: Two hour serum insulin
* BMI: Body Mass Index
* DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function
* Age: Age in years
* Outcome: Whether or not the patients have diabetes. 0 for no and 1 for yes.
