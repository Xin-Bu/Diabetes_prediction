# Predicting diabetes
### Description of the dataset
The dataset used in this project is originally from National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK). This project aims at building a logsitic regression model to predict diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements that are used as predictors. The predictors are BMI, insulin leve, age, pregnancies, glucose plasma, blood pressure, skin thickness, and diabetes pedigree function. The outcome variable is a binary one indicating whether or not the pateients have diabetes or not. 
The R code in this project for data visualization and logistic regression was written in R Markdown and knitted to html.
